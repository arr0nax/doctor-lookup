# Doctor Lookup

#### A Way To Find Doctors, March, 2017

#### By **Clayton Collins**

## Description

This app allows users to search for doctors based on their medical needs. Simply input an ailment and it queries the betterdoctor api to find the doctor you need.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Install gulp and bower (if not already installed)
* Run the commands constained in setup.sh
* Use `gulp build` and `gulp serve` to create the functional js and css
* Navigate to localhost:3000 in your web browser


## Known Bugs

There are many bugs with the API which did not lend themselves to quick solutions. Most notably, very few doctors/practices have websites, which makes it tricky to display any at all. The same goes for ratings. Also, the API does not always understand common queries. For example, 'toothache' did not return any results for me even in downtown Portland. Also if the user does not have navigation turned on in their browser, the search will default to Portland, which could be troublesome for searchers in other locations.
